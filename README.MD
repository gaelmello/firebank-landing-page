## About this project ...

<br/>

The idea of the project is to present the essential pillars of an attractive professional **landing page that has the potential to impact your client.**

Firebank is an example of fintech that was used as the context for the project.

However, **the entire code and structure of the page can be reused** to promote any other product or service.

<br/>

## Why?

<br/>

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so if you are able to provide any feedback on the project, code, page structure, or any other improvements, it would be amazing.
