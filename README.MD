## About this project ...

The idea of the project is to present the essential pillars of an attractive professional **landing page that has the potential to impact your client.**

Firebank is an example of fintech that was used as the context for the project.

However, **the entire code and structure of the page can be reused** to promote any other product or service.

<br/>

## Why?
